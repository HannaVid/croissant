    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains
      dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants
      belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with
      brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant usually contains normal
      levels of salt, yeast and sugar. The texture and eating quality of
      croissants are created:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Lamination:</strong>
        a folding process creates alternating dough and fat layers
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Expansion:</strong>
        caused by the leavening action of yeast fermentation, and physical
        separation of the dough and fat layers during the oven spring stage of
        baking as the water trapped between them vaporizes to steam.
      </li>
    </ul>
